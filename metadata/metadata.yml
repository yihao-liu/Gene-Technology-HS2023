name: Improving lab-of-origin prediction of genetically engineered plasmids via deep
  metric learning
description: This capsule provides the code associated with the article entitled "Deep
  Metric Learning Improves the Genetically Modified Plasmid Origin Prediction Laboratory",
  which implements deep metric learning using triple networks to improve the state
  of the art in predicting those responsible for genetic modification in plasmids,
  and also a new methodology for interpreting these models using integrated gradients.
